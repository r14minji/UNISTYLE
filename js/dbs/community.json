      "title" : "WHY IS EVERY BAG UNIQUE?",
      "answer" : "Our bags are not “artificially” unique; they are that way right from the beginning on. They are truly unique items, because they are made from used truck tarps. Every tarp has its own story, its own look and its own state of use. Furthermore each bag is still cut by hand in Zurich, Switzerland, and gets its individual look depending on the color, the writing and design of the tarp. That’s why every single product will be one of a kind."

      "title" : "WHY ARE YOU USING RECYCLED MATERIALS?",
      "answer" : "The basic idea was to make something useful from waste. Then, we started looking into truck tarpaulins because we didn’t know of any other material that was as tough. It was a mixture of intent and coincidence. The recycling idea is very important to us. But, we also want to offer functional, robust and stylish products — a bag that is fun to use in everyday life. The recycling gives it its unique character."

      "title" : "HOW TOUGH ARE FREITAG BAGS?",
      "answer" : "Trucks tarps are tough. Seeing as your FREITAG bag used to be one, “tough” is also the secret middle name of all FREITAG products. The materials and workmanship can hold up to years of serious daily use in the urban jungle. And if you’re nice to your FREITAG bag, it’ll be your perfect F-riend for life (or almost that long). Functional, reliable, undemanding, never boring and unique worldwide. That’s FREITAG. \\n P.S. If you ever take a bag made by our calfskin and crocodile-recycling competition for a walk in the rain, you’ll see exactly what we mean. "

      "title" : " HOW DO I CLEAN MY BAG?",
      "answer" : "There’s no exorbitantly expensive or highly-toxic special cleaner necessary for cleaning your FREITAG bag. H2O from the tap and some run-of-the-mill detergent that you trust dabbed on a soft cloth is all you need and will do the job perfectly. This will keep your bag happy, shiny and well protected. There are longstanding F-ans who swear that they clean their favorite bags regularly with a soft cloth and a bit of coffee creamer. (However, we can’t make it an official FREITAG Rejuvenation Committee recommendation for technical reasons, and because our mothers always told us not to play with our food.)"

      "title" : "WHEN ARE NEW FREITAG ONE-OFFS LAUNCHED? ",
      "answer" : "New unique products are not uploaded according to a particular schedule. Our warehouse and online restocking specialist Mr Gashi always works according to his gut feeling, the reproduction of individual models, as well as color and design availability - and he’s been doing it since the pre-Facebook era. So it’s always worth checking in regularly and if you have a really urgent request, you can contact him directly (but be aware, he’s not really a people person, he prefers forklifts and SAP systems and can sometimes be a bit grumpy if he’s under the pump - you have been warned)."

      "title" : "BUT DOESN'T LINEN LOSE ITS SHAPE? ",
      "answer" : "Manufacturing our Broken Twill in a very dense and unusual weave for linen makes it very tough. We have found the right mix of linen combined with hemp and modal for all of our textiles. The material changes when you wear it - it breathes and adapts to the wearer. All of the pieces of clothing become looser when worn. That’s why our clothes feel a bit stiff when you first try them on. Our advice is to buy FREITAG clothes in a size that feels slightly tight, as they will then become very comfortable when you wear them. Our materials also age differently than normal denim cloth - a process that we are very pleased with. And our natural fibers can be washed at just 86 degrees F - they don’t need it any hotter. As a bonus, all of the materials have been prewashed and preshrunk to minimize shrinking during the first wash."
